# Project Description
In this assignment we will be discussing regrading the Housing and comes the part where we earn or establish a business for our living sustenance so we wanted to check on the details related to business licenses and get some inputs from it. I got my datasets from website [City of Vancouver Open Data Portal](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/business-licences-2013-to-2024/information/?disjunctive.status)
## Project Title: Understanding Business License Information
The primary goal here is to conduct a descriptive analysis of the yearly trends in business License based on the datasets taken from [City of Vancouver Open Data Portal](City of Vancouver Open Data Portal](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/business-licences-2013-to-2024/information/?disjunctive.status)). The goal is to identify the percentage of business Licenses over time, which can help inform operational strategies for this license services, improve response times, and increase the licenses for their respective businesses.
## Project Objective:
* Business Licenses have become crucial part of our lives.
* I decided this will be my dataset to get information related to  business Licenses  in city of Vancouver.
* For the DAP design there are close to 13 steps. Am going to define and describe all these steps below.
There is one  datasets which i will be using here.
* The  dataset is **"Issued Business License"**, it contains information on issued business license, with columns such as:
  * [Cummulative-business-licences-2024.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17004732/Cummulative-business-licences-2024.xlsx)
## Methodology:
* The process of DAP designing and implementation is complex.
* This involves close to 13 different steps. I will be explaining on these steps in detail below:
### Step 1 - Data Analytical Question Formulation
* Data or Datasets are very important when we are going to analyse something. Similarly for me to implement DAP I need some datasets and metrics to calculate.
* As explained above I have the Business Licenses dataset, using this am going to design my DAP. The first step is to carefully select all the relevant metrics.
* Below displayed are a few sample metrics I selected: <br>

*  From this list I am going to select the descriptive metric “What is theissued rate of business licenses?” analysis.
*  By doing this we can understand the total number of licenses issued, the number of licenses still pending , and also the percentage of issued licenses to that of total licenses.
### Step 2 - Data Discovery
* This is the dataset I gathered pertaining to business license questions. The  type of license, validation of license, name, date of inquiry, status, and other details about the license that have been issued are all included in this dataset.
